\section{The Negative Binomial Distribution}
The negative binomial distribution is a univariate probability distribution that belongs to the discrete probability distributions. It models the number of trials required to achieve a given number of successes in a Bernoulli process. \\
The density is given by
\begin{equation}
    f\left(k,r,p\right)=\mathcal{P}\left(X=k\right)=\begin{pmatrix} k+r-1\\r-1\end{pmatrix}\left(1-p\right)^kp^r,
\end{equation}
with $r$ the number of successes, $k$ the number of failures, and $p$ the probability of success \cite{haldane1941fitting}.
